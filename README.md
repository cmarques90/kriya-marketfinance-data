Abstract:

In this paper we develop several machine learning models for predicting default on the invoice trading peer-to-business (P2B) market. Using several techniques like logistic regression, conditional inference trees, random forest, support vector machines and neural networks, we evaluate the prediction of the default rate. Our results show that these techniques can effectively improve detection of default by up to 56%, while maintaining levels of specificity above 70%. Contrary to other papers on the same topic, this was done by using sampling techniques to address the classification imbalance problem and by using different time periods for the training and test datasets to assure intertemporal validation and realistic predictions. Furthermore, we also study the pricing mechanism of P2B platforms with observed and implicit probability of default to check if sellers are being charged with a price that is realistically adjusted to the risk of the operation. Our results show that price is reflecting an implicit probability of default much higher than the observed probability of default, which in turn suggests that sellers are being overcharged.
